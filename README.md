# About Me 

Hey everyone, it's **me**, *your friendly neighborhood aspiring network admin* Zac Mennona.
I look forward to sharing with you some of the ideas and projects I am working on as part of the **Microsoft Software and Systems Academy**
> Of course, I need to build something to show off to you first...
